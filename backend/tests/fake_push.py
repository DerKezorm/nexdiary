"""A stand-in for a push service, as the transport of nexdiary's requests: it takes a message the way a real one does
and keeps what came. Every device it hands out has a key pair made for the run, so a test reads what nexdiary sent:
decrypted here by RFC 8291 itself (written out below, not with the library nexdiary encrypts with) and by
``http_ece`` as a second opinion. The VAPID signature is checked against the key in the header.

Nothing is switched off for it: its host is added to the operator's list of push services, its name resolves to a
public address (only in the tests, never connected to), and a request must come to that address with its name in
the Host header."""
