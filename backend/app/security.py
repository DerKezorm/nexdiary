"""Passwords, browser sessions, the brake against guessing, and the secrets the server keeps for itself.

Built after nextrmnl's: Argon2id for passwords, sessions as random tokens of which the database knows only the
hash, a brake per sender in memory and a lock per account in the database: five failures, then a quarter of an hour
of rest, per account and per address (decided 06.10.2026).

Sessions come in two lengths: with "stay signed in on this device" one lasts until it was not used for
``session_days`` (sliding, checked here, not left to the cookie); without, it ends with the browser and after
``SHORT_HOURS`` at the latest. A session right after the password of an account that still has to set up its second
factor is a stage of its own (``STAGE_SETUP``) and lives ``SETUP_MINUTES``.
