"""What profile pictures and photos have in common: knowing a picture by its first bytes, the limits on what comes in,
and opening it without letting it take the server down.

* **The kind** is read from the first bytes, never from the name or the type the browser claims. An SVG, an HTML page
  named ``.jpg``, a PDF: none of them is a picture here.
* **The size** is limited twice: the request guard holds the body to ``MAX_BYTES`` before anything reads it
  (``middleware.LARGE_BODIES`` names every route that takes a picture), and the decoder refuses more than
  ``MAX_PIXELS`` before it unpacks a single row (a 1-bit PNG can be tiny on disk and huge in memory).
* **Decoding is rationed**: at most ``NEXDIARY_DECODE_SLOTS`` pictures (one by default) are unpacked at the same moment,
  and at most ``WAITING`` more uploads may hold their body while they wait for a place (``admitted``). Any further one
  is turned away before its body is read (503, ``Retry-After``). A 36-megapixel photo needs some 150 MB while it is
  open; twenty at once from one family must not exhaust a small server.

Whatever is kept is drawn anew from the pixels (``services/avatars.py``, ``services/photos.py``): no place, no device,
no hidden second picture, no script survives.
