"""Setting a new password by a link.

The operator cannot set a password for anybody. Instead a person gets a link and sets their own: sent by the
operator ("Send a link to reset"), or asked for by the person on the sign-in page ("Forgot your password?") where a
mail server is set up and the account has an address.

* The link holds a random token. Only its SHA-256 is stored; it works once and runs out after 24 hours; at most one
  link is open per account, a new one replaces the one before.
* A link made for somebody else's request goes only to the address on record, and is built from the public address
  the operator set, never from the ``Host`` header a request brings.
* Using it sets the password, ends every session and every sign-in waiting for its second factor, and lifts a lock.
  The second factor stays: only the operator can take it (the reset of the second factor, its own act).
