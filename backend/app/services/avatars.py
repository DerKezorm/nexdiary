"""Profile pictures: what comes in is a picture of any kind a phone or camera makes; what is kept is a square WebP of
``SIZE`` pixels, drawn anew. Nothing of the file that came survives but its pixels: no place, no device, no hidden
second picture, no script in an SVG (an SVG is not taken at all).

Kept in the database next to the account (a few kilobytes), so every backup carries it and nothing lies beside.
Seen by everybody on the server: the family knows each other, and a shared day shows who shared it.
