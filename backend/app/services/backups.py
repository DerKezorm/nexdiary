"""Backups of the whole of nexdiary: the database and the files of the media folder, in one ZIP.

Built after nextrmnl's and nexlore's backup service:

* **The database is copied with SQLite's backup API**, never as a file: it runs in WAL mode, and a file copy misses
  what still sits in the ``-wal`` side file. The media files are copied after; they never change once written, so
  one added in between is at worst an extra file nobody points at.
* **The manifest lists every file with its size and sha256**, so the check before a restore can tell a damaged
  archive from a good one, and say what a restore would change.
* **Only automatic copies are pruned** (``scheduled`` and ``update``); one made by hand stays until deleted, and so
  does one brought in from elsewhere (``receive``, named ``…-upload.zip``), whatever kind its manifest names.
* **A restore happens at the next start.** ``stage_restore`` checks the archive, makes an ``update`` copy of the
  current state (the way back), unpacks into ``backups/restore-pending/`` and ends the process; Docker starts it
  again and ``apply_pending`` swaps the files before anything opens the database. A pending folder without its
  manifest is a half-written one and is thrown away, never applied.

What people write is sealed in the database already (``services/vault.py``), so the archive holds it only as
ciphertext. The master key that opens it is **never** part of a backup: it lies in ``keys/`` (or wherever
``NEXDIARY_MASTER_KEY_FILE`` points), outside the database and the media folder, and nothing here reads it. Without
it, a backup cannot be read, not even by the operator. Downloading an archive asks for the operator's password once
more.
