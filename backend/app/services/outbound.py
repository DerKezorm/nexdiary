"""Requests the server makes to an address somebody typed: the AI service of the operator (``services/ai.py``) and the
Immich of a person (``services/immich.py``). Taken over from nexlore, where it was worked out in a security review.

* **Resolved once, connected to exactly what was checked.** The name is looked up once per request; every address it
  gives is checked, and the connection goes to those addresses (tried in turn), never to a second lookup that could
  answer differently (DNS rebinding). Host header and TLS name stay the name that was typed.
* **Some addresses never**, whatever anybody types or allows: link-local (169.254.0.0/16, fe80::/10), multicast, the
  unspecified address, and the metadata services of cloud machines (``METADATA``), also where they hide inside an
  IPv6 address (mapped, NAT64, 6to4). Each caller adds its own rule on top (the AI: own network or internet; Immich:
  only the hosts the operator allowed).
* **No redirect is followed** (that led into the own network in nexlore), the answer is read up to a size, and the
  whole request, the answer read included, has one deadline: a service that sends a byte now and then holds nobody
  longer than that.
