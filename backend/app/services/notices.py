"""A notice when an account signs in from a new device: a push to the person's devices and a mail, when a mail server
is set up and the account has an address.

New is a browser without the device cookie of this account (``security.devices_of``). Nothing is said for the very
first sign-in of an account (there is no other device to warn), nor when the person switched it off
(``profile.notify_login``, on from the start).

The notice names the device and the browser as its user agent says, the network it came from (the address cut to its
network, no lookup of places anywhere), and the time in the person's zone. Its link leads to the own account,
Security. Sent in the background: a slow push service or mail server never holds the sign-in up.
