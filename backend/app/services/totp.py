"""The second factor: time-based one-time codes (RFC 6238) plus recovery codes. Taken over from nextrmnl.

* The seed is stored encrypted with the server secret (``security.encrypt_secret``), the recovery codes as HMACs with
  a key of the server's (``h1:`` and hex): whoever reads the database alone cannot test guesses against them. Lists
  made before that hold plain SHA-256 hashes; both forms are accepted, and every new list is made in the new one.
  Seed and codes are shown once, at enrolment, and never logged.
* Enrolment takes two steps. ``begin_enrolment`` draws a seed and keeps it in memory for ten minutes; confirming
  needs a code from the app (proves the app holds the seed) and the account's password (proves the person at the
  keyboard is the owner). Only then is the seed stored.
* A sign-in with a second factor takes two steps as well. The password step opens nothing: it parks the sign-in in
  memory under a random token and hands the browser that token in a cookie. The code step turns it into the
  session. Five wrong codes end the pending sign-in; every wrong code counts against the account like a wrong
  password, and the password step does not reset that count (only a passed code does), so knowing the password is
  no way around the lockout.
* A code counts once. The time step of the last accepted code is stored, and a code at or before that step is
  refused: something read over a shoulder cannot be replayed within its thirty seconds.

Implemented here rather than with a library: RFC 6238 is thirty lines, and the tests hold the RFC's own vectors.
