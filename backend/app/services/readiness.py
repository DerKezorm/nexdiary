""""Ready for the internet?": what nexdiary checks about itself before it is reachable from outside.

Each point is ``ok``, ``warn`` or ``bad`` with the values its sentence needs; the interface says what it means and
what helps. Checked at every call, from the request that asks and the server as it stands: nothing is remembered but
when the master key was last saved.
