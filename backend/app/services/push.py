"""Web Push, where it goes: the devices of each person, and sending to them.

* **The address of a device comes from outside.** The browser hands it over, so whoever holds a session could hand
  over any address and make the server send a request there. Only https, only the default port, never an address
  literal, and only to a known push service (``KNOWN_HOSTS``, plus what the operator adds); the name is resolved
  once per request, every address it gives must lie in the public internet, and the connection goes exactly there
  (``services/outbound.py``). No redirect is followed, the answer is read up to a few kilobytes, each request has a
  deadline.
* **What a device handed over is sealed** with the person's data key: the address is a key in itself, whoever knows
  it may send to the device. Only a keyed hash of it stays in the clear, so that signing up twice keeps one device.
* **A device that left is removed**: the push service answers 404 or 410 for an address that no longer exists.
  Anything else (429, 500, no answer) leaves it; the next message tries again.
* **No diary in a message.** What is sent is written by the server (a reminder, a sign-in notice, a probe), never
  anything a person wrote; ``services/reminders.py`` says where a question of the day may come along.
