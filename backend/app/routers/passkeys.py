"""Passkeys: list, add and remove the own (Account, Security), sign in with one, and confirm an act with one.

A passkey signs in on its own, without password and code: the device checked finger, face or PIN, and the key is
bound to nexdiary's address. Adding one needs the password (or, right after signing in, the session that sets up the
second factor); removing one needs the password. A failed answer counts like a wrong password: per address, and
against the account the passkey belongs to.
