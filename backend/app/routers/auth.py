"""Setting up the first account, signing in and out, the own account and its signed-in devices, and the operator's
list of accounts.

Every way in ends in ``start``: an account that needs a second factor and has none gets a session that may only set
it up (``STAGE_SETUP``); after the code and the recovery codes, ``/api/auth/setup/done`` swaps it for a full one.
Invitations are in ``routers/invites.py``, the second factor in ``routers/totp.py``, passkeys in
``routers/passkeys.py``.
